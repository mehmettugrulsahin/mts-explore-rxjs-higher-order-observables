# Use Higher Order Observables in RxJS Effectively

## Get started with higher order observables in RxJS
## Flatten a higher order observable with RxJS switch
## Flatten a higher order observable with mergeAll in RxJS
## Flatten a higher order observable with concatAll in RxJS
## Use RxJS switchMap to map and flatten higher order observables
## Use RxJS mergeMap / flatMap to map and merge high order observables
## Use RxJS concatMap to map and concat high order observables
